I have no idea who my teacher was. It was St. Davids Public School, and I believe I was able to walk to school by myself every day. We had nap time in the afternoons, I think. It was an older lady, I believe. I swiped some clay-- couldnt have been play-do at that time-- and then brought it to school for show and tell. I remember kids whispering that I stole it but the kind teacher would have none of it. There was a nap time in the afternoon, on our blankets. I remember a nice, large classroom, like a gym.

My teacher was Mrs. Fast. All I remember is that she was mean. I think she had glasses and short hair. We were in a classroom on the west side of the building-- I do remember that. Interesting: almost no memories at all of Grade 1, or Kindergarten, for that matter. But I do feel like I have notable memories of Grade 2. That big a difference? One year?

Mom and Mrs. Korten, I believe, put it together using cardboard, old bicycle rims, and an upside down bucket at the top. The parade assembled near the canning factory and I was told to wait for someone to put me into a spot in the parade. As more and more of the parade left, though, I panicked and just charged out and joined it at the first opening. Photo made the newspaper-- I cant remember which one. St. Catharines, I think.

Johnny was a very funny guy-- we both liked jokes, and fishing, and exploring. There was a house near his house where kids could go into the basement and see magazines and smoke. Very, very strange now that I think about it. I know Johnny was always somewhat reluctant to go there, and not reluctant. Ambivalent about it, I guess.

Teacher: Mr. Elzinga, who was interesting, but a bit mean. He used to pinch shoulders if someone was giving him trouble. Probably brother of Win Elzinga in Chatham. Otherwise, rather blank memories of this year. I remember some technical discussions of batteries-- I think I or someone asked if a small 9 volt battery-- since it had the required "voltage", couldnt start a car (some cars had 6 volt batteries at that time). I think he actually gave a pretty good explanation. (Enough voltage but not capacity).

Teacher: Norman Van Dyke. This was the year I conducted a mini-skirt contest, measuring to see how far above the knee the skirt was, on girls who volunteered for the contest. Several girls-- including Joany, and Ria Brouwer-- kept going to the bathroom to raise her skirt to see if she could do better. Norman Van Dyke was there watching and did nothing to discourage me.

At the school party at Sherkston Beach, Grace and I went for a walk into the dunes, as several class-mates were also doing (including Martin Bakker and Coreen Langendoen). I asked, "do you wanna neck", and she said "sure". So we did. She would have been a year younger than me at the time, so she was about 12, and I was 13. Could this have been in June of 1971 instead? It always seemed like Pat was the very next semester, which would had to be Sep 1971. If so, that strip of film is mis-dated.

Took the bus, which circled around Niagara-on-the-Lake. Irene and Margaret Vanderlaan were also still in the Christian School at that point.

Jim Zeyl was our home room teacher -- he washed out after making weird personal comments with sexual overtones to the class.

Must have been September or October 1971. I must have been in grade 10, and Pat was in grade 9. This picture is from yearbook, so would be close to that date, especially since her hair is quite short. I remember thinking it was quite sexy-- I liked her neck and her ear-lobes. She was wearing a purple turtle neck sweater and let me slide my hand up under it.

Had to use some acids and other deadly chemicals to clean the trailers. The drivers washed their own cabs. Boss was Hubert Vander something. I think. Not sure about dates. I generally worked Friday nights until very, very late, usually by myself. I used a yard tractor to pick up trailers and haul them into the garage and clean them.

Very nice car but the engine was burning oil by the time we got it and it soon began to use a quart of oil a week, then almost a quart a day. We bought the cheapest oil for it, by the gallon. I am pretty outraged today that Hank tried to convince mom and dad that it was my fault, that I must have been driving too aggressively. I think mom believed it. Also had Suzuki bike at the same time, as evident in picture. So when did Bill Kamps and I ride it the motorcycle to Stratford? We blew rings and I had to drive it back at very slow speeds, on back roads.

I dont think they did very well on the house-- they may have sold it, in 1973, for about as much as they paid for it in 1961. So note that the picture above, of the 1963 Impala (and others in that strip) are probably actually from late 1973 or early 1974. I thought the house was about $21K.

At Eden in Niagara on the Lake. Very tight final game. This was where I had my breakaway, splitting the defense, and then shooting it over top of the middle of the net. Confirmed from yearbook: this was the ONLY soccer championship at Beacon while I was there.

Spent summer working on campus, cutting grass and watching Terry Boerema sunbathe in a tiny bikini at the faculty apartments. Lived in John and Carla Bruinsmas apartment, with Rinke and Jim Ethridge, both of whom quit, homesick, before the end of the summer. At some point, I was going to drive up to Ontario with Pam Koster, and changed my mind at the last minute, which really pissed her off. Then I changed my mind again and drove up anyway, by myself, I believe. I have a vague, uncertain memory of Pam being quiet the next time I saw her. Think about that now-- it looks like I wanted badly to be rid of her for that trip.

I was giving Helen a ride home and stayed overnight. Helen had to work the next morning so Karin was asked to make me breakfast. She seemed to resent the obligation so she did so, somewhat rudely, in her nighty. Then she sat cross-legged on the floor as I ate reading "Helter Skelter" assuming, as I later learned, that she would never see this bozo ever again. Must have been on way home, but unusual that I would have been by myself with Helen.

I may have driven with Rick Vanderwoude, and I think we went to my parents house and stayed there overnight. I remember Rick commenting that my parents seemed nice. Near Fort Erie-- Helen has picture of me with guitar. Marcia was there, and Dennys Afman, with Irene! Did we give Helen a ride? At some point, she made breakfast for us (on the way back, probably) in a sheer night-gown which, in the backlit morning, was nearly transparent. Helen has a photo showing Ricks car in the background (a Dodge Demon or similar). That makes sense. In 1976, I was in Calgary so it had to be 1975. Probably we gave Helen a ride home, stayed overnight, then headed back to Chicago.

Who else? Janet Molenaar, Anita Verwoerd. Randy Kok? Cant remember right now. Karin and I almost immediately have a big argument with Karin over German culpability for the holocaust, during which she slapped my face. Karin took Grade 13 and entered as a sophomore.

It is definitely MARTHA (not Marthe). She is now married to Tiemens. Henry oddly told me several times that Martha really liked me. One night around this time, she came to our room looking for Henry-- or maybe not. And then she jumped me, very aggressively and we wrestled around for a while until I realized she wanted something specific. Neither of us ever acknowledged this event later, but she and Henry soon broke up.

Poem dated, very likely very close to the actual date. As we were walking back from Braigels, she put her arm around my waist and when we got to the bridge, she stopped me, put both arms around me, and French-Kissed me and gave me a long look to check out my reaction.

And Jackie was there (see pix). We camped at a provincial campground across the creek, rather than in the ICS Tent Ghetto. Did I play that year? Cant remember.

Which we drove to Chicago in October. Not sure when we sold it to Len Moelker but it was after 1989-07-29 (its in the barn at Tissiman house on video). We must have kept it while we had the Fairmont and well into the Malibu years. Actually, a pretty nice car, with a hilarious owners manual, in Russian-accent English. It broke down in Michigan, I believe. I think we needed a fan belt. I told the auto parts guy it was a Fiat because I didnt want trouble but when he couldnt find the part, I told him it was a Lada. Actually, a pretty nice car, with a hilarious owners manual, in Russian-accent English.

I was absolutely the first person I knew to buy a personal computer, except for Bernie Kruisselbrink and Harry Van Dyke maybe (he bought an AT clone around this time). Borrowed the money from Helens parents, which we paid back quickly.

I would have been employed at the half-way house, but they didnt get of the ground until much later due to community opposition. Ron Grainger and the hot little secretary. It was a little surreal. But here was where I first started learning dBase.
