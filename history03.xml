Not exact dates yet. He drove his car and I drove the van, I believe. Lots of snow. Laetitias friends didnt arrive for a few hours but they were very fast and efficient when they did. In the meantime, I killed myself hauling boxes up three flights of stairs! I stayed overnight and then drove the van back to Kitchener for Paul. Laetitias friends were pretty rude.

Just started hyperventilating and failed to pull over. Wandered across the median into opposing traffic lanes, then ended up in the grass median. Really quite scary. I was charged with careless driving and fought it in court in Peterborough and successfully had it reduced to inappropriate use of the median or something. Quite an interesting day at the courthouse watching other people going through the justice system. The car was towed into Peterborough and Insurance paid for a new Dakota pickup rental (only thing available).

The cottage itself was at the top of a pretty steep hill with barely a trail to it, but I enjoyed taking the CRV up it.

Went skiing at Blue Mountain all day, about 11:00 to 9:30p.m. Great day but very, very cold. Nobody on the slopes by the time I quit. Had very nice meal at the restaurant there for about $12.00, which is pretty reasonable considering its a captive audience. Photo from 2013 ski trip.

I got $1000 knocked off, then won $500 in some kind of draw they were having. Christopher got our old Corolla for a few thousand, which he paid back on monthly installments. After about a year, we "forgave" him the rest of the money, since we have basically given cars to Danielle and Paul. He then gave the Corolla (or sold it) to Dawn, and bought himself a used Subaru.

Rockefeller Center - 9/11 Memorial - Brandenburg Concertos. Had a generally great weekend, and really enjoyed the Brandenberg Concertoes at the Lincoln Center, Alice Tully Hall. Went to 9/11 Memorial, Rockefeller Center to see Christmas tree, great view, and MOMA for a Picasso sculpture exhibit. Took the CRV. We went to Empire State Building, Central Park, a cathedral north of Central Park, Godspell at a Broadway Theatre, Brooklyn Bridge, MOMA. Wonderful weekend. Had a bit of car trouble on the way home near Scranton: the front left wheel came loose. Stopped at an odd garage: nobody there, except two guys talking. Old, old shop. Office all dusty. Old cigarette and candy machines coated in dust. Dog.

Yes, girls, friends, whatever. She was fine about it later in life. Met her again about 25 years later and she was glad to see me, which made me feel good about what our relationship had actually been like. I got the impression that she had kind memories of it. Most likely this was in 1995 or so-- I think it was 25th anniversary of Beacon starting. That could be 1970 when they moved to Trinity Church, or 1968 when they started at Calvin.

Purchased it to replace CRV which had developed serious clutch problems, while still running pretty good. No A/C either. Purchase price: about 19K including tax. Mileage at time of purchase: 54K. I add about 250k a week regular driving plus additional mileage for trips: about 25k a year, estimated.
