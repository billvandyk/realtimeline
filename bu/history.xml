Just started hyperventilating and failed to pull over.  Wandered across the median into opposing traffic
lanes, then ended up in the grass median.  Really quite scary.  I was charged with careless driving and 
fought it in court in Peterborough and successfully had it reduced to inappropriate use of the median or 
something.  Quite an interesting day at the courthouse watching other people going through the justice
system.
