and joined it at the first opening.

Johnny was a very funny guy-- we both liked jokes, and fishing, and exploring.  There was 
a house near his house where kids could go into the basement and see magazines and smoke.  
Very, very strange now that I think about it.  I know Johnny was always somewhat reluctant 
to go there, and not reluctant.  Ambivalent about it, I guess.

us some spirituals and generally had a lot of music.  He also showed us the infamous live

Just started hyperventilating and failed to pull over.  Wandered across the median into opposing traffic
lanes, then ended up in the grass median.  Really quite scary.  I was charged with careless driving and 
fought it in court in Peterborough and successfully had it reduced to inappropriate use of the median or 
something.  Quite an interesting day at the courthouse watching other people going through the justice
system.
