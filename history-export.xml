I have no idea who my teacher was. It was St. Davids Public School, and I believe I was able to walk to school by myself every day. We had nap time in the afternoons, I think. It was an older lady, I believe. I swiped some play-doh and then brought it to school for show and tell. I remember kids whispering that I stole it but the kind teacher would have none of it. There was a nap time in the afternoon, on our blankets. I remember a nice, large classroom, like a gym.

My teacher was Mrs. Fast. All I remember is that she was mean. I think she had glasses and short hair. We were in a classroom on the west side of the building-- I do remember that. Interesting: almost no memories at all of Grade 1, or Kindergarten, for that matter. But I do feel like I have notable memories of Grade 2. That big a difference? One year?

Mom and Mrs. Korten, I believe, put it together using cardboard, old bicycle rims, and an upside down bucket at the top. The parade assembled near the canning factory and I was told to wait for someone to put me into a spot in the parade. As more and more of the parade left, though, I panicked and just charged out and joined it at the first opening. Photo made the newspaper-- I cant remember which one. St. Catharines, I think.

Johnny was a very funny guy-- we both liked jokes, and fishing, and exploring. There was a house near his house where kids could go into the basement and see magazines and smoke. Very, very strange now that I think about it. I know Johnny was always somewhat reluctant to go there, and not reluctant. Ambivalent about it, I guess.

When she came out, her suit had clearly become transparent.

Teacher: Mr. Elzinga, who was interesting, but a bit mean. He used to pinch shoulders if someone was giving him trouble. Probably brother of Win Elzinga in Chatham. Otherwise, rather blank memories of this year. I remember some technical discussions of batteries-- I think I or someone asked if a small 9 volt battery-- since it had the required "voltage", couldnt start a car (some cars had 6 volt batteries at that time). I think he actually gave a pretty good explanation. (Enough voltage but not capacity).

Teacher: Norman Van Dyke. This was the year I conducted a mini-skirt contest, measuring to see how far above the knee the skirt was, on girls who volunteered for the contest. Several girls-- including Joany, and Ria Brouwer-- kept going to the bathroom to raise her skirt to see if she could do better. Norman Van Dyke was there watching and did nothing to discourage me.

Must have been September or October 1971. I must have been in grade 10, and Pat was in grade 9. This picture is from yearbook, so would be close to that date, especially since her hair is quite short. I remember thinking it was quite sexy-- I liked her neck and her ear-lobes.

Had to use some acids and other deadly chemicals to clean the trailers. The drivers washed their own cabs. Boss was Hubert Vander something. I think. Not sure about dates. I generally worked Friday nights until very, very late, usually by myself. I used a yard tractor to pick up trailers and haul them into the garage and clean them.

Very nice car but the engine was burning oil by the time we got it and it soon began to use a quart of oil a week, then almost a quart a day. We bought the cheapest oil for it, by the gallon. I am pretty outraged today that Hank tried to convince mom and dad that it was my fault, that I must have been driving too aggressively. I think mom believed it. Also had Suzuki bike at the same time, as evident in picture. So when did Bill Kamps and I ride it to Stratford?

I dont think they did very well on the house-- they may have sold it, in 1973, for about as much as they paid for it in 1961. So note that the picture above, of the 1963 Impala (and others in that strip) are probably actually from late 1973 or early 1974.

At Eden in Niagara on the Lake. Very tight final game. This was where I had my breakaway, splitting the defense, and then shooting it over top of the middle of the net. I think we won first championship at Niagara Christian College. Hard to figure. Check yearbook.

Attending Trinity Christian College. First impression: at a campfire on the "the hill" I was trying hard to be funny, joking about "flanged niblicks" from Canada. I remember Terry Brown also clowning around a bit. Roomed with Gary Teune at first, until he bombed out, and then Ray Wieringa, in Vandervelde Hall.

Spent summer working on campus, cutting grass and watching Terry Boerema sunbathe in a tiny bikini at the faculty apartments. Lived in John and Carla Bruinsmas apartment, with Rinke and Jim Ethridge, both of whom quit, homesick, before the end of the summer. At some point, I was going to drive up to Ontario with Pam Koster, and changed my mind at the last minute, which really pissed her off. Then I changed my mind again and drove up anyway, by myself, I believe. I have a vague, uncertain memory of Pam being quiet the next time I saw her. Think about that now-- it looks like I wanted badly to be rid of her for that trip.

I was giving Helen a ride home and stayed overnight. Helen had to work the next morning so Karin was asked to make me breakfast. She seemed to resent the obligation so she did so, somewhat rudely, in her nighty. Then she sat cross-legged on the floor as I ate reading "Helter Skelter" assuming, as I later learned, that she would never see this bozo ever again. Must have been on way home (date) but unusual that I would have been by myself with Helen, but not totally unlikely.

(!) I may have driven with Rick Vanderwoude, and I think we went to my parent\s house and stayed there overnight. I remember Rick commenting that my parents seemed nice. Near Fort Erie-- Helen has picture of me with guitar. Marcia was there, and Dennys Afman, with Irene! Did we give Helen a ride? At some point, she made breakfast for us (on the way back, probably) in a sheer night-gown which, in the backlit morning, was nearly transparent. Helen has a photo showing Ricks car in the background (a Dodge Demon or similar). That makes sense. In 1976, I was in Calgary so it had to be 1975.

It is definitely MARTHA (not Marthe). She is now married to Tiemens. Henry oddly told me several times that Martha really liked me. One night around this time, she came to our room looking for Henry-- or maybe not. And then she jumped me, very aggressively and we wrestled around for a while until I realized she wanted something specific. Neither of us ever acknowledged this event later, but she and Henry soon broke up.

Which we drove to Chicago in October. Not sure when we sold it to Len Moelker but it was after 1989-07-29 (its in the barn at Tissiman house on video). We must have kept it while we had the Fairmont and well into the Malibu years. Actually, a pretty nice car, with a hilarious owners manual, in Russian-accent English. It broke down in Michigan, I believe. I think we needed a fan belt. I told the auto parts guy it was a Fiat because I didnt want trouble but when he couldnt find the part, I told him it was a Lada. Actually, a pretty nice car, with a hilarious owners manual, in Russian-accent English.

With a Postma-- not Steve, I think. Nice guy. Notes here Wonder what hes doing now? He was a good worker and showed me some of the ropes. I remember the first time we carried a new windows from the truck, it was too heavy for me-- we gripped it with gloves on the sides-- and I had to put it down for a second. I didnt know that putting it down on the concrete would destroy the "seal". Cost Ron Stronks a pretty penny, but he was pretty reasonable about it.

Picture dated 1988-07, probably right after we bought it (being waxed). It was time to replace the Lada, which we eventually sold to Len Moelker no earlier than July 1989-- there is video if it in the garage at 116 Tissiman. But the Fairmont had problems stalling in wet weather. Referred to in very funny Christmas letter, 1988. Hard to find a picture but the Malibu replaced it and its definitely there by 1989-07. Helen had an accident with it 1989-06

(!) Paul Vanderkooy moved to Chatham, teaching at CCS, with Helen. We connected somewhere and started jamming together. I believe I first started jamming with Brad, and then Paul joined us. Around this time, Susan Vanderkooy began to "recover" memories of sexual abuse by her father. In retrospect, the "recovered" portion of this episode raises suspicions. Susan eventually left Paul for someone else and lived with him in GR. They might have gotten back together eventually.

Moved there from Chatham, until move to 11 Ramblewood Way 1999. Lovely house on a court, nice pool for the kids, open field behind us (later filled by a condo). A house we liked a lot, though it was not large. The pool was great. Good neighborhood. Our kids played lots of ball hockey and other games with the neighbors, including Barney, Sarah, Beverly, Yann and Emmanual...

(!) We had acquired the Camry earlier to replace Malibu. Start date pretty good. There is a photo of the 4Runner with the 1984 Accord, then, AFTER, the Camry. So the Camry replaced the Malibu by 1996-06. We kept the Malibu for a while to try to sell it but nobody wanted it, so we junked it. The Camry caught fire and the 4Runner replaced it. But 1997-06 film set shows 4Runner WITH the Accord, then ten frames later, the Camry in Paris, which, I think was about when we bought it.

Basically, acquired to replace 4Runner, but we kept 4Runner for some time for Paul and for general use as 3rd car until the clutch finally blew near Van Eeks house, I believe. Eventually, Paul assumed ownership of the Civic as he moved to Montreal. A mechanic there convinced him to have the timing belt replaced without him asking us-- we had just replaced it before giving him the car.

Just started hyperventilating and failed to pull over. Wandered across the median into opposing traffic lanes, then ended up in the grass median. Really quite scary. I was charged with careless driving and fought it in court in Peterborough and successfully had it reduced to inappropriate use of the median or something. Quite an interesting day at the courthouse watching other people going through the justice system. The car was towed into Peterborough and Insurance paid for a new Dakota pickup rental (only thing available).

A week at a beautiful cottage in Connecticut near New Haven. There was a steam locomotive in a small town named Essex nearby. Also an old piano factory. We toured Yale but failed to ask about George Bushs Fraternity. We saw the movie Terence Malick film "Tree of Life" there, on a very, very hot day. The cottage itself was at the top of a pretty steep hill with barely a trail to it, but I enjoyed taking the CRV up it.

Vacation at cottage in New Hampshire. Lovely cottage. Drove down to coast to see colonial village. Artsy town called Portsmouth. Founded in 1623 Also went to Concord, nice downtown, very hot. Saw great deals at thrift shop but passed on Dyson vacuum for $120-- regretfully.

I got $1000 knocked off, then won $500 in some kind of draw they were having. Christopher got our old Corolla for a few thousand, which he paid back on monthly installments. After about a year, we "forgave" him the rest of the money, since we have basically given cars to Danielle and Paul.

Rockefeller Center - 9/11 Memorial - Brandenburg Concertoes. Had a generally great weekend, and really enjoyed the Brandenberg Concertoes at the Lincoln Center, Alice Tully Hall. Went to 9/11 Memorial, Rockefeller Center to see Christmas tree, great view, and MOMA for a Picasso sculpture exhibit. Took the CRV. We went to Empire State Building, Central Park, a cathedral north of Central Park, Godspell at a Broadway Theatre, Brooklyn Bridge, MOMA. Wonderful weekend. Had a bit of car trouble on the way home near Scranton: the front left wheel came loose. Stopped at an odd garage: nobody there, except two guys talking. Old, old shop. Office all dusty. Old cigarette and candy machines coated in dust. Dog.

Yes, girls, friends, whatever. She was fine. Met her again about 25 years later and she was glad to see me, which made me feel good about what our relationship had actually been like. I got the impression that she had kind memories of it. Most likely this was in 1995 or so-- I think it was 25th anniversary of Beacon starting. That could be 1970 when they moved to Trinity Church, or 1968 when they started at Calvin.

During the dances, later at night, after most people had cleared the floor, Sara Matovic saw me with the camera. She came up to me, took my camera away and put it on a table and pulled me onto the dance floor and put her arms around me. Helen came along and "rescued" me.

Miraculous unassuming of puppy romance at this late stage of the game. How divinely expressive of a pristine elevation of purely Platonic mutual admiration.

Got a cavity in back, left, lower molar. Not really great candidate for filling, so had it pulled. Took about a half hour, not too painful.

The cottage was free, from a family involved in the Christian school-- any teacher could have it for a week or so. Everyone was there, including Olive of course. Nice area, of course. A beach, a snack bar, and little ATV sort of golf cart.

I video-recorded this wedding, produced a blu-ray disk for the families. Was a lavish wedding, out at the Zeamans farm, lots of food and music and probably the highest number of beautiful young people Ive ever seen at a wedding. Christine DeGier was there too. Sara Matovic approached me for a dance late at night-- Helen rescued me.

Purchased for $400 used from someone on Kijiji who didnt want me to meet him at his house. We met in front of Walmart. I made the call and bought it and had a new (smaller" SIM put in at Koodo in the mall. So far so good.
