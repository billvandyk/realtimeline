We did the bus tour, which was actually fun-- we had a good guide.  Then a boat tour around Manhattan island.  Greenwhich village, WTC, Central Park
where we found Lennon's memorial.

Just started hyperventilating and failed to pull over.  Wandered across the median into opposing traffic
lanes, then ended up in the grass median.  Really quite scary.  I was charged with careless driving and 
fought it in court in Peterborough and successfully had it reduced to inappropriate use of the median or 
something.  Quite an interesting day at the courthouse watching other people going through the justice
system.
