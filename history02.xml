With a Postma-- not Steve, I think. Nice guy. Notes here Wonder what hes doing now? He was a good worker and showed me some of the ropes. I remember the first time we carried a new windows from the truck, it was too heavy for me-- we gripped it with gloves on the sides-- and I had to put it down for a second. I didnt know that putting it down on the concrete would destroy the "seal". Cost Ron Stronks a pretty penny, but he was pretty reasonable about it.

Hired by Julie Farrell, who, I discovered by accident (going through filing cabinets), had connived her way into the position by telling staff she had been appointed assistant executive director by the previous executive director who had just been fired. Then revealing that the current CEO was having an affair with a board member. It was something like that. I met Susan Powers in waiting area, thought she was Julie, and had a charming conversation with her. Susan was Volunteer Coordinator.

started with Trinity project... very strange situation. Through the Pearson Center, I met Joy Pyymaki and her staff and began doing occasional consulting work at the Womens Shelter. I will always remember that whenever I came to the front door, I was greeted with overt hostility, until the volunteer answering the door found out I was a consultant. Joy and Julie were both attempting to sabotage the project because they wanted the project funding for their own programs and they didnt like the director of Family Services.

Picture dated 1988-07, probably right after we bought it (being waxed). It was time to replace the Lada, which we eventually sold to Len Moelker no earlier than July 1989-- there is video if it in the garage at 116 Tissiman. But the Fairmont had problems stalling in wet weather. Referred to in very funny Christmas letter, 1988. Hard to find a picture but the Malibu replaced it and its definitely there by 1989-07. Helen had an accident with it 1989-06

There is a picture dated 1991 showing the Malibu in driveway. Christmas letter from 1989 confirms: we bought Malibu that year! Helens dad heard from George Antuma that someone had traded in this nice Malibu and the dealer was willing to sell it to us for the trade-in value he gave on it. About $3,000 I think. It was a pretty good deal.

Paul Vanderkooy moved to Chatham, teaching at CCS, with Helen. We connected somewhere and started jamming together. I believe I first started jamming with Brad, and then Paul joined us. Around this time, Susan Vanderkooy began to "recover" memories of sexual abuse by her father. In retrospect, the "recovered" portion of this episode raises suspicions. Susan eventually left Paul for someone else and lived with him in GR. They might have gotten back together eventually. They now live in Nova Scotia.

Moved there from Chatham, until move to 11 Ramblewood Way 1999. Lovely house on a court, nice pool for the kids, open field behind us (later filled by a condo). A house we liked a lot, though it was not large. The pool was great. Good neighborhood. Our kids played lots of ball hockey and other games with the neighbors, including Barney, Sarah, Beverly, Yann and Emmanual...

We had acquired the Camry earlier to replace the Malibu. Start date pretty good. There is a photo of the 4Runner with the 1984 Accord, then, AFTER, the Camry. So the Camry replaced the Malibu by 1996-06. We kept the Malibu for a while to try to sell it but nobody wanted it, so we junked it. The Camry caught fire and the 4Runner replaced it. But 1997-06 film set shows 4Runner WITH the Accord, then ten frames later, the Camry in Paris, which, I think was about when we bought it. Did it replace the 1984 Accord?

It rained quite a bit during this outdoor ceremony in a park but Cathenia was determined to not move indoors. The minister actually asked for a miracle-- stop the rain! And it started raining harder.

The end of the 4Runner. Clutch, I think, blew out. Too many other problems (especially tailgate, window, etc.) to justify further investment.

Exact dates. I set them up together. One of the daughters, I believe the second one, gave a very inappropriate speech at the reception, joking about catching them in delecti on the couch one night.

Dates from pictures - July 20 to August 4. There was a bizarre incident with one of Karins close friends-- an inappropriate kiss or something, and an allusion to lesbianesque desire. We rented a very nice vehicle in Calgary, with a GPS, and returned from Victoria. I drove most of the time because Ann didnt trust Als driving. In fact, once, in Victoria, I wanted to switch because I was tired and sleepy but Ann strenuously objected --because we were in the city-- and I kept driving.
